The sun rose over the mountains, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. Birds chirped melodiously, welcoming the new day. A gentle breeze rustled through the trees, carrying the scent of blooming flowers. In the distance, a river sparkled under the sunlight, winding its way through the valley. A deer cautiously stepped out of the forest, its ears twitching at every sound. Nearby, a squirrel darted up a tree, clutching an acorn in its tiny paws. The peaceful scene was briefly interrupted by the distant rumble of thunder. Dark clouds began to gather, hinting at an approaching storm.
