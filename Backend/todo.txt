# TODO
- Split prompts into generating questions and check open answers

- Add function to check if given answer to open question is correct
    - given text, question, answer
    - return pts 0-100 (as %)
    - TEST how accurate (and consistent) the AI is. If necessary, add threshold like e.g. 75-100 pts = MAX points.
        - accuracy: ask AI for perfect answer to the question. check this answer. if it's not 100%, then make corrections.
        - consistency: same answer should result in same number of points 
- Add Flask for API communication
    - generate questions:
        args: text, closed amount, open amount, allow multiple, force multiple
        return: json with questions
    - rate the answer to open question:
        args: text, question, answer
        return: number of points (0-100 representing %)

- Create server.py. Move flask startup there. api_endpoints should contain just endpoints.
- Fix forcing multiple correct answers
- Create new directories. Sort files.
