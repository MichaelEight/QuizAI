# TODO
Frontend:
- Create pages (either react router or just swap content on one page by hiding the other one):
    - Source text input, multiline
    - Settings:
        - numerical: amount of open questions:
        - numerical: closed questions
        - checkbox: allow multiple correct answers
        - checkbox: force multiple correct answers
        - dropdown: level of questions (basic, academic etc)
    - Quiz page (must be separate):
        - Randomize order of questions
        - Display current question and field for answers: either ABCD (each is button) or text input
        - Buttons:
            - Check answer (compares to correct answers)
            - Next (active after 'check answer' triggered)
            - Mark as invalid (for AI errors)

- Take care of data handling:
    - Save to localStorage (or cookies)
    - Pass information between pages. Either state manager or prop as arguments
    - Data to save:
        - Input text
        - Settings
        - Questions
    - User must have the ability to go back without losing any data. Generate new questions only after pressing "Generate".


Backend further plans:
- Fix forcing multiple correct answers
- Make sure there is error handling for everything (e.g. OpenAI API errors)
- Document API, so it's clear, when it returns what (e.g. how to recognize errors)
- Add actual unit tests
